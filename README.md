This is a simple collection of templates to create super simple applications based on PyQt5.

It was created to gather user input from a Raspberry Pi computer connected to a small display (5 to 10 inches). Originally, the design supported input from a 4x4 keypad (like the one in the picture), but it was extended to support touchscreens as well.

The applications are intended to be simple and straightforward, with the user navigating between menus and dialogs.
