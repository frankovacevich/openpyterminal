This is a simple collection of templates to create super simple applications based on PyQt5.

It was created to gather user input from a Raspberry Pi computer connected to a small display (5 to 10 inches). Originally, the design supported input from a 4x4 keypad (like the one in the picture), but it was extended to support touchscreens as well.

![keypad](/other/keypad.jpeg "Keypad").

When the keypad is meant to be used, the key "*" inserts a decimal separator (".") and the key "#" serves as backspace. The keys "A", "B", "C" and "D" are programmable. The numeric keys are used for numbers, as expected, except in case of lists where the "2" and "8" keys also serve for "up" and "down".

The applications are intended to be simple and straightforward, with the user navigating between menus and dialogs.

The icons used were partly downloaded from the [Remix Set](https://github.com/Remix-Design/remixicon.). Other icons were taken from [SubtleIcons](https://frankovacevich.github.io/subtleicons/).
